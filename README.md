# Tag ClassName 🔥

## Description

This snippet is a useful tool for 
react developers, allowing the rapid creation of HTML elements with class 
attributes. When entering the prefix associated with each tag HTML (such as 
"divc" for div), the editor automatically inserts the tag with a classname 
attribute, which is the correct syntax to specify JSX/React classes, instead of 
the used "class" attribute in standard HTML.
